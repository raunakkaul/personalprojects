I implemented a lexer, parser, and evaluator in OCaml. The lexer was responsible for converting the source code into a sequence of tokens, the parser translated these tokens into an abstract syntax tree (AST), and the evaluator processed the AST to execute and compute the final result. This comprehensive system allowed for the efficient analysis and interpretation of source code written in OCaml, demonstrating proficiency in language processing and execution within the OCaml environment.
